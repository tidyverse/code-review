# Welcome {.unnumbered}

A code review is a process where someone other than the author of a piece of code examines that code.
At Posit, we use code review to maintain the quality of our code and products.

This guide serves as a reference for different aspects of the code review process.
It is written with the *tidyteam* in mind, which make up the combination of the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/), [tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org/), and [mlops](https://vetiver.rstudio.com/) groups, but is generally applicable to a large amount of the software development we do at Posit.
The guide is intended to be used as a way to get new developers up to speed on how we perform code review, and to serve as a linkable resource when there are questions about aspects of the code review process.

We mostly use [GitHub](https://github.com/) as the hosting platform for our code, so many details of this guide might refer to aspects specific to doing pull requests using GitHub's tooling.
Additionally, we have a number of R packages that facilitate working on R packages and authoring/reviewing pull requests.
In particular, you will see references to [`devtools`](https://devtools.r-lib.org/) and [`usethis`](https://usethis.r-lib.org/) throughout this guide.

We will use the abbreviation PR to mean a *pull request*, typically on GitHub.
