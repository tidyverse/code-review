    "text": "What Do Code Reviewers Look For?\nCode reviews should look at:\n\nDesign: Is the code well-designed and appropriate for your system? Does the code follow the design guide?\nFunctionality: Does the code behave as the author likely intended? Is the way the code behaves good for its users?\nComplexity: Could the code be made simpler? Would another developer be able to easily understand and use this code when they come across it in the future?\nTests: Does the code have correct and well-designed automated tests?\nNaming: Did the developer choose clear names for variables, classes, methods, etc.?\nComments: Are the comments clear and useful?\nStyle: Does the code follow our style guide?\nDocumentation: Did the developer also update relevant documentation?\n\n\nPicking the Best Reviewers\nIn general, you want to find the best reviewers you can who are capable of responding to your review within a reasonable period of time.\nThe best reviewer is the person who will be able to give you the most thorough and correct review for the piece of code you are writing. This usually means the owner(s) of the code, who may or may not be the people in the OWNERS file. Sometimes this means asking different people to review different parts of the CL.\nIf you find an ideal reviewer but they are not available, you should at least CC them on your change.\n\n\nIn-Person Reviews (and Pair Programming)\nIf you pair-programmed a piece of code with somebody who was qualified to do a good code review on it, then that code is considered reviewed.\nYou can also do in-person code reviews where the reviewer asks questions and the developer of the change speaks only when spoken to."

Make the freelist larger, and add a goroutine that frees the freelist entries slowly over time, so that idle servers eventually release all freelist entries.\n\nThe first few words describe what the CL actually does. The rest of the description talks about the problem being solved, why this is a good solution, and a bit more information about the specific implementation.\n\n\n1.4.2 Refactoring\nExample:\n\nConstruct a Task with a TimeKeeper to use its TimeStr and Now methods.\nAdd a Now method to Task, so the borglet() getter method can be removed (which was only used by OOMCandidate to call borglet’s Now method). This replaces the methods on Borglet that delegate to a TimeKeeper.\nAllowing Tasks to supply Now is a step toward eliminating the dependency on Borglet. Eventually, collaborators that depend on getting Now from the Task should be changed to use a TimeKeeper directly, but this has been an accommodation to refactoring in small steps.\nContinuing the long-range goal of refactoring the Borglet Hierarchy.\n\nThe first line describes what the CL does and how this is a change from the past. The rest of the description talks about the specific implementation, the context of the CL, that the solution isn’t ideal, and possible future direction. It also explains why this change is being made.\n\n\n1.4.3 Small CL that needs some context\nExample:\n\nCreate a Python3 build rule for status.py.\nThis allows consumers who are already using this as in Python3 to depend on a rule that is next to the original status build rule instead of somewhere in their own tree. It encourages new consumers to use Python3 if they can, instead of Python2, and significantly simplifies some automated build file refactoring tools being worked on currently.\n\nThe first sentence describes what’s actually being done. The rest of the description explains why the change is being made and gives the reviewer a lot of context."

    "section": "2.1 Why Write Small CLs?",
    "text": "2.1 Why Write Small CLs?\nSmall, simple CLs are:\n\nReviewed more quickly. It’s easier for a reviewer to find five minutes several times to review small CLs than to set aside a 30 minute block to review one large CL.\nReviewed more thoroughly. With large changes, reviewers and authors tend to get frustrated by large volumes of detailed commentary shifting back and forth—sometimes to the point where important points get missed or dropped.\nLess likely to introduce bugs. Since you’re making fewer changes, it’s easier for you and your reviewer to reason effectively about the impact of the CL and see if a bug has been introduced.\nLess wasted work if they are rejected. If you write a huge CL and then your reviewer says that the overall direction is wrong, you’ve wasted a lot of work.\nEasier to merge. Working on a large CL takes a long time, so you will have lots of conflicts when you merge, and you will have to merge frequently.\nEasier to design well. It’s a lot easier to polish the design and code health of a small change than it is to refine all the details of a large change.\nLess blocking on reviews. Sending self-contained portions of your overall change allows you to continue coding while you wait for your current CL in review.\nSimpler to roll back. A large CL will more likely touch files that get updated between the initial CL submission and a rollback CL, complicating the rollback (the intermediate CLs will probably need to be rolled back too).\n\nNote that reviewers have discretion to reject your change outright for the sole reason of it being too large. Usually they will thank you for your contribution but request that you somehow make it into a series of smaller changes. It can be a lot of work to split up a change after you’ve already written it, or require lots of time arguing about why the reviewer should accept your large change. It’s easier to just write small CLs in the first place."

    "section": "2.2 What is Small?",
    "text": "2.2 What is Small?\nIn general, the right size for a CL is one self-contained change. This means that:\n\nThe CL makes a minimal change that addresses just one thing. This is usually just one part of a feature, rather than a whole feature at once. In general it’s better to err on the side of writing CLs that are too small vs. CLs that are too large. Work with your reviewer to find out what an acceptable size is.\nThe CL should include related test code.\nEverything the reviewer needs to understand about the CL (except future development) is in the CL, the CL’s description, the existing codebase, or a CL they’ve already reviewed.\nThe system will continue to work well for its users and for the developers after the CL is checked in.\nThe CL is not so small that its implications are difficult to understand. If you add a new API, you should include a usage of the API in the same CL so that reviewers can better understand how the API will be used. This also prevents checking in unused APIs.\n\nThere are no hard and fast rules about how large is “too large.” 100 lines is usually a reasonable size for a CL, and 1000 lines is usually too large, but it’s up to the judgment of your reviewer. The number of files that a change is spread across also affects its “size.” A 200-line change in one file might be okay, but spread across 50 files it would usually be too large.\nKeep in mind that although you have been intimately involved with your code from the moment you started to write it, the reviewer often has no context. What seems like an acceptably-sized CL to you might be overwhelming to your reviewer. When in doubt, write CLs that are smaller than you think you need to write. Reviewers rarely complain about getting CLs that are too small."

    "text": "2.3 When are Large CLs Okay?\nThere are a few situations in which large changes aren’t as bad:\n\nYou can usually count deletion of an entire file as being just one line of change, because it doesn’t take the reviewer very long to review.\nSometimes a large CL has been generated by an automatic refactoring tool that you trust completely, and the reviewer’s job is just to verify and say that they really do want the change. These CLs can be larger, although some of the caveats from above (such as merging and testing) still apply.\n\n\n2.3.1 Splitting by Files\nAnother way to split up a CL is by groupings of files that will require different reviewers but are otherwise self-contained changes.\nFor example: you send off one CL for modifications to a protocol buffer and another CL for changes to the code that uses that proto. You have to submit the proto CL before the code CL, but they can both be reviewed simultaneously. If you do this, you might want to inform both sets of reviewers about the other CL that you wrote, so that they have context for your changes.\nAnother example: you send one CL for a code change and another for the configuration or experiment that uses that code; this is easier to roll back too, if necessary, as configuration/experiment files are sometimes pushed to production faster than code changes."

For example, moving and renaming a class should be in a different CL from fixing a bug in that class. It is much easier for reviewers to understand the changes introduced by each CL when they are separate.\nSmall cleanups such as fixing a local variable name can be included inside of a feature change or bug fix CL, though. It’s up to the judgment of developers and reviewers to decide when a refactoring is so large that it will make the review more difficult if included in your current CL."

Remember that smallness here refers the conceptual idea that the CL should be focused and is not a simplistic function on line count.\nA CL that adds or changes logic should be accompanied by new or updated tests for the new behavior. Pure refactoring CLs (that aren’t intended to change behavior) should also be covered by tests; ideally, these tests already exist, but if they don’t, you should add them.\nIndependent test modifications can go into separate CLs first, similar to the refactorings guidelines. That includes:\n\nValidating pre-existing, submitted code with new tests.\n\nEnsures that important logic is covered by tests.\nIncreases confidence in subsequent refactorings on affected code. For example, if you want to refactor code that isn’t already covered by tests, submitting test CLs before submitting refactoring CLs can validate that the tested behavior is unchanged before and after the refactoring.\n\nRefactoring the test code (e.g. introduce helper functions).\nIntroducing larger test framework code (e.g. an integration test)."

When a reviewer provides a critique of your code, think of it as their attempt to help you, the codebase, and Google, rather than as a personal attack on you or your abilities.\nSometimes reviewers feel frustrated and they express that frustration in their comments. This isn’t a good practice for reviewers, but as a developer you should be prepared for this. Ask yourself, “What is the constructive thing that the reviewer is trying to communicate to me?” and then operate as though that’s what they actually said.\nNever respond in anger to code review comments. That is a serious breach of professional etiquette that will live forever in the code review tool. If you are too angry or annoyed to respond kindly, then walk away from your computer for a while, or work on something else until you feel calm enough to reply politely.\nIn general, if a reviewer isn’t providing feedback in a way that’s constructive and polite, explain this to them in person. If you can’t talk to them in person or on a video call, then send them a private email. Explain to them in a kind way what you don’t like and what you’d like them to do differently.

It’s often really satisfying to finally send one out for review, feel like it’s done, and be pretty sure that no further work is needed. It can be frustrating to receive comments asking for changes, especially if you don’t agree with them.\nAt times like this, take a moment to step back and consider if the reviewer is providing valuable feedback that will help the codebase and Google. Your first question to yourself should always be, “Do I understand what the reviewer is asking for?”\nIf you can’t answer that question, ask the reviewer for clarification.\nAnd then, if you understand the comments but disagree with them, it’s important to think collaboratively, not combatively or defensively:\nBad: “No, I’m not going to do that.”\nGood: “I went with X because of [these pros/cons] with [these tradeoffs]. My understanding is that using Y would be worse because of [these reasons]. Are you suggesting that Y better serves the original tradeoffs, that we should weigh the tradeoffs differently, or something else?”\nRemember, courtesy and respect should always be a first priority. If you disagree with the reviewer, find ways to collaborate: ask for clarifications, discuss pros/cons, and provide explanations of why your method of doing things is better for the codebase, users, and/or Google.\nSometimes, you might know something about the users, codebase, or CL that the reviewer doesn’t know.

However, as the reviewer you should still be thinking about edge cases, looking for concurrency problems, trying to think like a user, and making sure that there are no bugs that you see just by reading the code.\nYou can validate the CL if you want—the time when it’s most important for a reviewer to check a CL’s behavior is when it has a user-facing impact, such as a UI change. It’s hard to understand how some changes will impact a user when you’re just reading the code. For changes like that, you can have the developer give you a demo of the functionality if it’s too inconvenient to patch in the CL and try it yourself.\nAnother time when it’s particularly important to think about functionality during a code review is if there is some sort of parallel programming going on in the CL that could theoretically cause deadlocks or race conditions. These sorts of issues are very hard to detect by just running the code and usually need somebody (both the developer and the reviewer) to think through them carefully to be sure that problems aren’t being introduced. (Note that this is also a good reason not to use concurrency models where race conditions or deadlocks are possible—it can make it very complex to do code reviews or understand the code.)"

The future problem should be solved once it arrives and you can see its actual shape and requirements in the physical universe."

At Google, we hire great software engineers, and you are one of them. If you can’t understand the code, it’s very likely that other developers won’t either. So you’re also helping future developers understand this code, when you ask the developer to clarify it.\nIf you understand the code but you don’t feel qualified to do some part of the review, make sure there is a reviewer on the CL who is qualified, particularly for complex issues such as privacy, security, concurrency, accessibility, internationalization, etc.\n\n5.10.1 Exceptions\nWhat if it doesn’t make sense for you to review every line?

For example, you might see only four new lines being added, but when you look at the whole file, you see those four lines are in a 50-line method that now really needs to be broken up into smaller methods.\nIt’s also useful to think about the CL in the context of the system as a whole. Is this CL improving the code health of the system or is it making the whole system more complex, less tested, etc.? Don’t accept CLs that degrade the code health of the system.

When you reject a change like this, it’s also a good idea to suggest to the developer what they should have done instead.\nFor example, you might say “Looks like you put some good work into this, thanks! However, we’re actually going in the direction of removing the FooWidget system that you’re modifying here, and so we don’t want to make any new modifications to it right now. How about instead you refactor our new BarWidget class?”\nNote that not only did the reviewer reject the current CL and provide an alternative suggestion, but they did it courteously. This kind of courtesy is important because we want to show that we respect each other as developers even when we disagree.\nIf you get more than a few CLs that represent changes you don’t want to make, you should consider re-working your team’s development process or the posted process for external contributors so that there is more communication before CLs are written.

Often, there is one file that has the largest number of logical changes, and it’s the major piece of the CL. Look at these major parts first. This helps give context to all of the smaller parts of the CL, and generally accelerates doing the code review. If the CL is too large for you to figure out which parts are the major parts, ask the developer what you should look at first, or ask them to split up the CL into multiple CLs.\nIf you see some major design problems with this part of the CL, you should send those comments immediately, even if you don’t have time to review the rest of the CL right now. In fact, reviewing the rest of the CL might be a waste of time, because if the design problems are significant enough, a lot of the other code under review is going to disappear and not matter anyway.\nThere are two major reasons it’s so important to send these major design comments out immediately:\n\nDevelopers often mail a CL and then immediately start new work based on that CL while they wait for review. If there are major design problems in the CL you’re reviewing, they’re also going to have to re-work their later CL. You want to catch them before they’ve done too much extra work on top of the problematic design.\nMajor design changes take longer to do than small changes.

The speed of individual development is important, it’s just not as important as the velocity of the entire team.\nWhen code reviews are slow, several things happen:\n\nThe velocity of the team as a whole is decreased. Yes, the individual who doesn’t respond quickly to the review gets other work done. However, new features and bug fixes for the rest of the team are delayed by days, weeks, or months as each CL waits for review and re-review.\nDevelopers start to protest the code review process. If a reviewer only responds every few days, but requests major changes to the CL each time, that can be frustrating and difficult for developers. Often, this is expressed as complaints about how “strict” the reviewer is being. If the reviewer requests the same substantial changes (changes which really do improve code health), but responds quickly every time the developer makes an update, the complaints tend to disappear. Most complaints about the code review process are actually resolved by making the process faster.\nCode health can be impacted. When reviews are slow, there is increased pressure to allow developers to submit CLs that are not as good as they could be. Slow reviews also discourage code cleanups, refactorings, and further improvements to existing CLs."

So interrupting yourself while coding is actually more expensive to the team than making another developer wait a bit for a code review.\nInstead, wait for a break point in your work before you respond to a request for review.

(Note: none of this means you should interrupt coding even to send a response like this—send the response at a reasonable break point in your work.)\nIt is important that reviewers spend enough time on review that they are certain their “LGTM” means “this code meets our standards.” However, individual responses should still ideally be fast."

In general you should strike an appropriate balance between pointing out problems and providing direct guidance.

It also can result in a better solution, because the developer is closer to the code than the reviewer is.\nHowever, sometimes direct instructions, suggestions, or even code are more helpful. The primary goal of code review is to get the best CL possible. A secondary goal is improving the skills of developers so that they require less and less review over time.\nRemember that people learn from reinforcement of what they are doing well and not just what they could do better. If you see things you like in the CL, comment on those too! Examples: developer cleaned up a messy algorithm, added exemplary test coverage, or you as the reviewer learned something from the CL.

Upsets are usually more about the way comments are written than about the reviewer’s insistence on code quality."

    "text": "9.3 Cleaning It Up Later\nA common source of push back is that developers (understandably) want to get things done. They don’t want to go through another round of review just to get this CL in. So they say they will clean something up in a later CL, and thus you should LGTM this CL now. Some developers are very good about this, and will immediately write a follow-up CL that fixes the issue. However, experience shows that as more time passes after a developer writes the original CL, the less likely this clean up is to happen. In fact, usually unless the developer does the clean up immediately after the present CL, it never happens. This isn’t because developers are irresponsible, but because they have a lot of work to do and the cleanup gets lost or forgotten in the press of other work. Thus, it is usually best to insist that the developer clean up their CL now, before the code is in the codebase and “done.” Letting people “clean things up later” is a common way for codebases to degenerate.\nIf a CL introduces new complexity, it must be cleaned up before submission unless it is an emergency. If the CL exposes surrounding problems and they can’t be addressed right now, the developer should file a bug for the cleanup and assign it to themselves so that it doesn’t get lost. They can optionally also write a TODO comment in the code that references the filed bug."

    "text": "9.4 General Complaints About Strictness\nIf you previously had fairly lax code reviews and you switch to having strict reviews, some developers will complain very loudly. Improving the speed of your code reviews usually causes these complaints to fade away.\nSometimes it can take months for these complaints to fade away, but eventually developers tend to see the value of strict code reviews as they see what great code they help generate. Sometimes the loudest protesters even become your strongest supporters once something happens that causes them to really see the value you’re adding by being strict."

    "text": "10.1 What Is An Emergency?\nAn emergency CL would be a small change that: allows a major launch to continue instead of rolling back, fixes a bug significantly affecting users in production, handles a pressing legal issue, closes a major security hole, etc.\nIn emergencies we really do care about the speed of the entire code review process, not just the speed of response. In this case only, the reviewer should care more about the speed of the review and the correctness of the code (does it actually resolve the emergency?) than anything else. Also (perhaps obviously) such reviews should take priority over all other code reviews, when they come up.\nHowever, after the emergency is resolved you should look over the emergency CLs again and give them a more thorough review."

    "text": "10.3 What Is a Hard Deadline?\nA hard deadline is one where something disastrous would happen if you miss it. For example:\n\nSubmitting your CL by a certain date is necessary for a contractual obligation.\nYour product will completely fail in the marketplace if not released by a certain date.\nSome hardware manufacturers only ship new hardware once a year. If you miss the deadline to submit code to them, that could be disastrous, depending on what type of code you’re trying to ship.\n\nDelaying a release for a week is not disastrous. Missing an important conference might be disastrous, but often is not.\nMost deadlines are soft deadlines, not hard deadlines. They represent a desire for a feature to be done by a certain time. They are important, but you shouldn’t be sacrificing code health to make them.\nIf you have a long release cycle (several weeks) it can be tempting to sacrifice code review quality to get a feature in before the next cycle. However, this pattern, if repeated, is a common way for projects to build up overwhelming technical debt. If developers are routinely submitting CLs near the end of the cycle that “must get in” with only superficial review, then the team should modify its process so that large feature changes happen early in the cycle and have enough time for good review."
